# Numerical Simulation Cases of Diaphragm Valve
This repository includes two simulation cases with inlet BC set as _flowRateInletVelocity_ and _timeVaryingMappedFixedValue_, respectively, for demonstration. These simulation cases are compatible with OpenFOAM v8. 

This repository also includes a test report from International Center for Water Technology (ICWT), which serves as independent validation data for our simulation results.
